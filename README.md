Autismal Gaffers Destroy Gumption - What to look at if you're new

## If you actually wanted the link list go [here](http://alloyed.github.io/agdg-links)

If you want to add or change anything, do the usual fork and pull
request thing, or just open an issue. I'll also respond to DMs through
github or messages on freenode, user ```alloyed```.

The html template is stored in ```_layouts```, the markdown holding the links
in ```index.md```, and the css and images in ```css/``` and ```img/```,
respectively.

Finally, the old gist can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Alloyed/6c0d2f1fa476fc3ba61f)
