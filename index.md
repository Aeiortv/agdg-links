## posting progress

	Just like make GIFs. record your vidya to show to all your little internet buddies and complain when the colors come out wrong.

	Dickstory is fraps but good. Useful for recording audio or longer format video. Check /rs/.

*	<http://dropbox.com>

	<http://puu.sh>

	<http://mega.co.nz>

	Free hosting for game demos. Dropbox hosts html, which means js  or unity webplayer games run fine. Puush links directly, which works for .swf or .love files.

*	<http://pastebin.com>

	<http://hastebin.com>

	Don't try to post your shit code to 4chan directly, use a pastebin. hastebin will autodetect language for syntax highlighting, which is nice.

## Free shit

All free shit will either be labeled CC-NOPE meaning not actually "free" per se and will probably slam you with a C&D, CC-BY-NC, meaning it cannot be used commercially, or CC0 meaning do whatever the fuck you want. Note that I am using these as umbrella licenses and they may or may not actually apply.

### Free Sounds

*	<http://www.freesound.org>

	A sound effect portal, includes both amateur and professional work. Not really geared toward gamedev. (CC-BY-NC)

*	<http://www.superflashbros.net/as3sfxr/>

	Lofi bleeps 'n bloops synth. Click the mutate button and get 100% original, low-effort effects. (CC0)

*	<https://soundcloud.com/search/sounds?q=vgm&filter.license=to_modify_commercially>

	Creative Commons licensed soundcloud tracks. Modify the search to fit your needs. (CC0)

### Free Grafix

*	<http://www.spriters-resource.com/ >

	Sprites from existing games. (CC-NOPE)

*	<http://opengameart.org/>

	A portal for placeholder art. Licences vary. (CC-BY-NC)

	Screenshots of lowpoly art. Good for references/inspiration. (CC-NOPE)

### Free(/Open-Source) Software

*	<https://github.com/amgade/gamedev-alternatives>

	Gamedev in a way that respects your freedumbs. Some of these are drop-in replacements for existing software, while others just fill the same gap. One of the easiest ways to get to do some collab work is to pick a project, get to work, and submit a pull request when you're done. (CC0/CC-BY-NC)
